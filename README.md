# Agave OS

![Desktop Environment](assets/terminal.png)
Agave OS is a simple operating system written in Rust with WASI support. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It is also designed to be easy to customize and extend. Started from [Fomos](https://github.com/Ruddle/Fomos) and the second edition of
[Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Philipp Oppermann. Also contains code from [Theseus OS](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus).

- Explore the desktop environment
- Test graphics, animations, and system features interactively
- Works on most modern browsers
- Contributions and bug reports are welcome! (barely works so far keyboard input needs fixing)

## WASM Applications

Enhanced WASM applications now support rich graphics and animations:

```rust
use agave_lib::{
    clear_screen, draw_circle, fill_circle, draw_triangle, 
    get_dimensions, get_time_ms, Position, RGBA
};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn update(mouse_x: i32, mouse_y: i32) {
    let dim = get_dimensions();
    let time = get_time_ms();
    
    // Clear with animated background
    clear_screen(RGBA::new(10, 10, 20, 255));
    
    // Draw animated elements
    let phase = (time as f32 / 1000.0) * 2.0 * 3.14159;
    let center = Position::new(dim.width / 2, dim.height / 2);
    let radius = 50 + (phase.sin() * 20.0) as i32;
    
    fill_circle(center, radius, RGBA::new(255, 100, 150, 200));
    
    // Interactive mouse following
    fill_circle(
        Position::new(mouse_x, mouse_y),
        15,
        RGBA::new(100, 255, 100, 255)
    );
}
```

## üîß Building and Running

```powershell

# Use deno for tasks
deno task run-all

# Or use nu for tasks
nu agave.nu run-all

# Or use bash for tasks
./agave.sh run-all

# Or use powershell for tasks
./agave.ps1 run-all

# Or use cmd for tasks
./agave.bat run-all

```

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly toolchain
- QEMU (for running the OS)

### Quick Start

```powershell
deno task run-all
```

## üìä System Monitoring

The OS includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Memory Statistics** - Allocation tracking, peak usage, fragmentation analysis
- **Task Metrics** - Spawn/completion rates, execution time, context switches
- **Performance Events** - Memory pressure, queue status, performance anomalies
- **Health Monitoring** - Automatic detection of system issues
- **Profiling** - Function-level performance measurement

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Kernel** (`crates/kernel`) - Core OS functionality
- **API** (`crates/api`) - System APIs and drivers
- **Library** (`crates/lib`) - WASM application library
- **Applications** (`apps/`) - WASM applications

### Enhanced Systems

- **Error Handling** (`sys/error.rs`) - Comprehensive error types
- **Memory Management** (`sys/allocator.rs`) - Advanced allocation tracking
- **Task Scheduling** (`sys/task/`) - Priority-based async execution
- **System Monitoring** (`sys/monitor.rs`) - Performance and health tracking
- **WASM Runtime** (`sys/wasm.rs`) - Enhanced WebAssembly execution

## üêõ Debugging

Enhanced panic handler provides detailed system information:

- System uptime and current state
- Memory usage and allocation statistics
- Task execution metrics
- Recent performance events
