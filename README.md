# <img src="assets/Agave.png" width="70rem" /> Agave OS

Agave OS is a simple operating system written in Rust with WASI support. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It is also designed to be easy to customize and extend. Started from [Fomos](https://github.com/Ruddle/Fomos) and the second edition of
[Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Philipp Oppermann. Also contains code from [Theseus OS](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus)

```rust
use agave_lib::{
    clear_screen, draw_circle, fill_circle, draw_triangle, 
    get_dimensions, get_time_ms, Position, RGBA
};

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn update(mouse_x: i32, mouse_y: i32) {
    let dim = get_dimensions();
    let time = get_time_ms();
    
    // Clear with animated background
    clear_screen(RGBA::new(10, 10, 20, 255));
    
    // Draw animated elements
    let phase = (time as f32 / 1000.0) * 2.0 * 3.14159;
    let center = Position::new(dim.width / 2, dim.height / 2);
    let radius = 50 + (phase.sin() * 20.0) as i32;
    
    fill_circle(center, radius, RGBA::new(255, 100, 150, 200));
    
    // Interactive mouse following
    fill_circle(
        Position::new(mouse_x, mouse_y),
        15,
        RGBA::new(100, 255, 100, 255)
    );
}
```

## üîß Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly toolchain
- QEMU (for running the OS)

### Quick Start

```powershell
# Build and run in debug mode
deno task build

# Build release version
.\build.ps1 -Release

# Build with tests
.\build.ps1 -Test

# Clean build
.\build.ps1 -Clean

# Verbose logging
.\build.ps1 -Verbose -Run
```

### Manual Building

```bash
# Build test application
cd apps/test-app
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release

# Build OS
cd ../..
cargo run --release build

# Run with QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/release/bios.img -m 512M
```

## üìä System Monitoring

The OS includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- **Memory Statistics** - Allocation tracking, peak usage, fragmentation analysis
- **Task Metrics** - Spawn/completion rates, execution time, context switches
- **Performance Events** - Memory pressure, queue status, performance anomalies
- **Health Monitoring** - Automatic detection of system issues
- **Profiling** - Function-level performance measurement

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Kernel** (`crates/kernel`) - Core OS functionality
- **API** (`crates/api`) - System APIs and drivers
